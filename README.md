# ASP MVC 5, Entity Framework and Unit Testing
Basically I am trying to figure out how to get a reference to the database context during the testing of a controller that is using service injection. 

When injecting the database context for a test how would one get ahold of the in memory database and add data to it so you could fully exersize the controller method.
