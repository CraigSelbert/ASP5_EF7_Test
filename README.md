# ASP5_EF7_Test
Trying to figure out how to get the context during the test

As I am researching ASP.NET 5 and Entity Framework 7 I wanted to try and get to know the next frameworks.  My main question here is

When injecting the database context for a test how would one get ahold of the in memory database and add data to it so you could fully exersize the controller method.
